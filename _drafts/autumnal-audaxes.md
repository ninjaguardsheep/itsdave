#### Boys of Summer

*I road the local (to me) Welland Wonder 100 miler on what turned out to be the last day of summer.*

I arrived at the HQ in Husbands Bosworth at bang on <time>08:00</time>, passing the starting riders on the 160 after a flat, fast run out of Leicester into the early morinig.

Wasting no time collecting my brevet card and a couple of digestives for the road I set off only 10 minutes behind the start and soon ran into a gent called Norman struggling with the (notoriously vague) routesheet. Norman soon confessed that this was his first 100 mile ride (first 200k after riding to and from the start, I pointed out).

We made rapid progress to the first control at Long Buckby, climbing into the town for a warm welcome at The Old King's Head (free bacon cobs and all the squash you could drink!).

We arrived at the same time as the lead riders on the 100k, but from a different direction.
