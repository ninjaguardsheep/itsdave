#### Welland Wonder

I arrived at the HQ in Husbands Bosworth at bang on <time>08:00</time>, passing the starting riders on the 160 after a flat, fast run out of Leicester into the early morinig.

Wasting no time collecting my brevet card and a couple of digestives for the road I set off only 10 minutes behind the start and soon ran into a gent called Norman struggling with the (notoriously vague) routesheet.

We made rapid progress to the first control at Long Buckby, climbing into the town for a warm welcome at The Old King's Head (free bacon cobs and all the squash you could drink!).

Progress was similarly rapid heading northeast along quiet Northamptonshire lanes to the second control at Great Easton, passed by several club runs on thousands of pounds worth of carbon.

The day had warmed up considerably by the time we descended into Great Easton, we spent a pleasent quarter of an hour sat on the pavement outside the Post Office putting away a can of Coke and a slice of cake.

The intermediate section of the ride headed north through Rutland, climbing out of the Welland Valley and looping around the east side of Rutland Water. Throwing a series of continuous undulations at us and sapping the legs in the heat.

Eventually we arrived at the Potting Shed cafe just north of Oakham.

The final leg of the ride had me on familliar territory, north and east Leicestershire lanes I ride regularly. 
The lumps became further apart but grew larger. A long steady climb away from Oakham to Knossington was followed by fast rolling country lanes to Cold Newton and a nasty little climb up Sludge Hill.

At this point we caught two other riders on the hills, Corrie and John and we rode the next section across the A47 and up to Ilston on the Hill together.

After a pleasent half in the sunny beer garden (a pint would have made a second far too tempting) and having our bottles refilled with ice water by the landlord, Corrie and john set off slightly ahed of myself and Norman.

The final section was mostly fast rolling and quite pleasent apart from two significant hills and the westward run back to the HQ into the setting sun along the glider port boundary road was lovely.
