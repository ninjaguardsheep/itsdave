I arrived at the HQ in Husbands Bosworth at bang on <time>08:00</time>, passing the starting riders on the 160 after a flat, fast run out of Leicester into the early morinig.

Wasting no time collecting my brevet card and a couple of digestives for the road I set off only 10 minutes behind the start and soon ran into a gent called Norman struggling with the (notoriously vague) routesheet.

We made rapid progress to the first control at Long Buckby, climbing into the town for a warm welcome at The Old King's Head (free bacon cobs and all the squash you could drink!).

Progress was similarly rapid heading east to the second control at Great Easton, passed by several club runs on thousands of pounds worth of carbon.
