## About The Blog

Hi, I'm Dave, this is my blog.

<img class="round" src="/assets/img/about.png">

It exists because I wanted to play with static site generators. It's currently built with [cobalt.rs](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) because it has *just* enough features for a small blog.

All content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) unless otherwise stated, and the source can be found [here](https://github.com/theoriginalbigbaddave/itsdave).

It's mainly going to be stuff about cycling, computers and cats. So, if none of those things float your boat, close the tab now.

You can find me elsewhere on the internet:

+ Being sociable *(shudder)* on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ninjaguardsheep)

+ Cycling on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6001450)

+ Occasional boring cycling videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIBF_vjZRcAmMdVKIFFIXDg)
