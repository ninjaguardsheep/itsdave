Hi, I'm Dave.

This is my blog, it exists because I wanted to play with static site generators. It is currently built with [cobalt.rs](https://cobalt-org.github.io/).

All content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and the source can be found [here](https://github.com/theoriginalbigbaddave/itsdave).

It's mainly going to be stuff about cycling, computers and cats. So, if none of those things float your boat, close the tab now.

You can find me elsewhere on the internet at:
