Hi, I'm Dave.

This is my blog, it exists because I wanted to play with static site generators. It is currently built with [cobalt.rs](https://cobalt-org.github.io/).

It lives on a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) in my spare room (be nice).

All content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and the source can be found [here](https://github.com/theoriginalbigbaddave/itsdave).

It's mainly going to be stuff about cycling, computers and cats. So, if none of those things float your boat, close the tab now.
