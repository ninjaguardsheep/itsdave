## About The Blog

Hi, I'm Dave, this is my blog.

<img class="img_round" src="/assets/img/about.png" />

It exists because I wanted to play with static site generators. It's currently built with [cobalt.rs](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) because it has *just* enough features for a small blog and the documentation for [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (the templating language it uses) didn't make me want to kill myself.

All content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) unless otherwise stated, and the source can be found [here](https://github.com/ninjaguardsheep/itsdave).

This site uses statically generated flat html5 and css files. It currently uses no javascript and does no user tracking of any kind (although I may occasionally embed content from unscrupulous third parties like youtube).

It's mainly going to be stuff about cycling, computers and cats. So, if none of those things float your boat, maybe do something else with your afternoon.
