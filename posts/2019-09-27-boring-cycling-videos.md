So Nat bought me a GoPro Hero 2018 for my 30th.

I'd been looking for a way to record interesting things I'd seen on rides, but shyed away from action cameras because they're for angry cyclists to film all the rucks they get in on the road. And I'm far to old and cynical for that obviously... *Ahem*.

But, after rushing out to get a mount and a faster SD card *(turns out not all class 10 cards are created equal)* before we went away to The Dales. I gave riding with the camera bar mounted a go, and got some great results.

To be fair its hard to make The Dales look rubbish, but I was impressed by the quality of the footage I returned with and how little ride time was taken up faffing with the camera. The video from that ride is embedded at the bottom of this page.

I wouldn't want to mount it on my lid, it'd see more but it's a bit bulky and heavy, plus you look a berk. 

It takes *alright* still photos as well.

Anyway, recently I've been re-editing the videos I have compiled from previous rides down to 5 minutes or less *(less minutes, less boring)* and sticking them on youtube. You can see the results [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIBF_vjZRcAmMdVKIFFIXDg).
