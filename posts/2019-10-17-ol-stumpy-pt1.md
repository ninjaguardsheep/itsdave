*Forgive me father for I have sinned. It has been 5 years since my last bike but, although I have tried to resist, N+1 has been calling me...*

I had a bit of a *fuck it* moment at work earlier this month, so now I'm building a gravel bike.

To be fair, it was pretty much inevitable when the speculative parts spreadsheet started.

I've been throwing the idea around for a while now, since I rode the [Strade Bianci di Essex](https://www.strava.com/activities/1469667299) a couple of years ago on my Audax bike. That what was missing from my stable was a bike with proper off-road capability.

## Tech

I'm a Luddite.

I come from the school of Learning by Breaking Things *(expensive, but effective!)* and tend to favour simple systems with well-established trouble shooting steps over new and exciting tech *(because that [Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), is a bastard)*.
