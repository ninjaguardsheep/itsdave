*Forgive me father for I have sinned. It has been 5 years since my last bike but, although I have tried to resist, N+1 has been calling me.*

I had a bit of a *fuck it* moment at work earlier this month, I was bored, so I started spending money.

I'm building a gravel bike. To be fair, it was pretty much inevitable when the speculative parts spreadsheet started.

I've been throwing the idea around for a while now, since I road the [Strade Bianci di Essex](https://www.strava.com/activities/1469667299) on my Audax bike *(and only shit myself on a couple of the descents)*. That what was missing from my stable was a bike with proper off-road capability.

## Tech

I'm a fucking Luddite.

I come from the school of Learning by Breaking Things *(expensive, but effective!)* and tend to favour simple systems with well-established trouble shooting steps over new and exciting tech *(because that [Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), is a bastard)*.

That being said, this build is going to involve some new *(to me)* bike tech.

### Thru Axle

Meh, just use plenty of grease on installation so the bloody things don't seize into your frame (especially if it's steel).

### Hydraulic Disk Brakes

Yeah... I'll get back to you on that one when I have trimmed the hoses.

### 1X

Should be straightforward. I hope...

### Tubeless

I've tended to discount tubless setups in the past as too much faff and insufficiently Murphy proof for general and endurance riding. But, that no longer holds.

Having read up on this new breed of tubless clincher tires the system seems to provide the best of both worlds *(for off-road low pressure applications, anyway)*. Self Sealing Puncturesâ„¢ and no pinch flats paired with well established troubleshooting kit from familiar tube-and-clincher setups (tire boots and spare inner tubes).

#### U wot m8?

In case you are as clueless about tubless as I was about a month ago, traditional tubeless setups have used *tubular* tyres. Basically an inner tube with integrated tread that has to be glued on to the rim, with *glue* and *swearing*.

Newer systems using **Tubeless Ready** branded rims *and* tires use a sealing tape on the inner surface of the rim (to make it airtight) and effectively, a clincher tyre. Along with a liquid latex sealant to plug any gaps.

The tire bead and the bead locks on the rim differ in design slightly from standard clinchers to provide a more secure seat and a better air seal.

#### Setup

'Twas OK.

The hunt wheels I bought came pre-taped, and I was able to mount the Clement Strada tires with just my thumbs and some swearing.

I removed the valve cores, added the recommended amount of sealant and attacked with my cheap track pump.

The tires seated on the rims first time with scary loud snapping and popping sounds that I've been lead to believe is normal with TR. I then spent around 5 minutes hoola-hooping each wheel around to distribute the sealant.

After leaving them over night the front stayed up and the back went down, not great not terrible. I added more sealant to the deflated tire, pumped it back up and it was still inflated when I got back from work. Sucess, I think.
