title: Tubless Tyre Setup
description: "Look Mum, no tubes!"

Having bought a set of pre-taped Tubless Ready wheels for my work in progress gravel bike build, I decided I might as well have a go at setting them up tubeless.

I've tended to discount tubless setups in the past as too much faff and insufficiently [Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law) proof for general and endurance riding. But, that no longer holds.

Having read up on this new breed of tubless clincher tyres the system seems to provide the best of both worlds *(for off-road, low pressure applications anyway)*. Self Sealing Puncturesâ„¢ *(well, maybe)* and no pinch flats paired with well established troubleshooting kit from familiar tube-and-clincher setups (if you get a puncture that won't seal, you just throw in an inner tube and carry on).

## U wot m8?

In case you are as clueless about tubless as I was about a month ago, traditional tubeless setups have used *tubular* tyres. Basically an inner tube with integrated tread that has to be *glued on to the rim* and sounds like a right faff if you have a problem with it in the field.

New systems using **Tubeless Ready** or **Tubless Compatible** or **Tubless Easy** or **UST** *(depending on which set of marketing wankers you're buying them from)* branded rims and tyres use a sealing tape on the inner surface of the rim (to make it airtight) and what is to all intents and purposes, a clincher tyre. Along with a liquid latex sealant to plug any gaps and make the whole thing airtight.

The tyre bead and the bead locks on the rim differ in design slightly from standard clinchers to provide a more secure seat and a better air seal apparantly.

## Kit

I got me a pair of Clement Strada USH tyres and a MASON x HUNT 650B Adventure Sport wheelset, both in 650b, and a bottle of Stans No Tubes sealant.

## Setup

The hunt wheels I bought came pre-taped, and I was able to mount the Clement Strada tyres with just my thumbs and some swearing.

I removed the valve cores, added the recommended amount of sealant and attacked with my cheap track pump.

The tyres seated on the rims first time with scary loud snapping and popping sounds that I've been led to believe is normal with TR. I then spent around 5 minutes hoola-hooping each wheel around to distribute the sealant.

After leaving them over night the front stayed up and the back went down.

So I added more sealant to the deflated tyre, pumped it back up and it was still inflated when I got back from work.

Sucess! I think.
