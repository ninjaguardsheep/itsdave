I get a kick out of route planning. 
Either coming up with my own, or else virtually recce-ing *(not a word?)* other people's.

It builds anticipation for big rides or new routes.

Endlessly tweaking and re-tweaking, scouting this corner or that section of road on Street View. Cutting out this section of main road or that complicated junction. Eventually arriving at the perfect route with the easiest navigation, the nicest surfaces and the best views.
