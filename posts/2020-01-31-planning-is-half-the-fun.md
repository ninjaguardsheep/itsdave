I get a kick out of route planning. 
Either coming up with my own, or else virtually recce-ing *(not a word?)* other people's.

It builds anticipation for big rides or new routes.

Endlessly tweaking and re-tweaking, scouting this corner or that section of road on Street View. Cutting out this section of main road or that complicated junction. Eventually arriving at the perfect route with the easiest navigation, the nicest surfaces and the best views. 

I usually use Strava's route builder to plot the route because its free and produces a clean gpx track for my Garmin.

But, for scouting and planning a route I use a variety of online mapping tools.

## Open Street Map

Freely available, crowdsourced, open data! Highly detailed in the UK and Europe, their cycling specific layer adds emphasis to cycle routes and rideable byways like NCN routes and bridleways.

## Google Maps

Has Street View that covers most of the UK on public roads. Provides decent info on points of interest and local buisnesses in the area you are viewing.

## Bing Maps

Bing maps is sorely under rated and nowhere near as shit as the rest of Bing's offering. They have more detailed overhead sattelite imagery than Google for large parts of the UK, especially in rural or wild areas and they have a 1:2500 scale OS layer!

Good for checking the condition of bridleways and restricted byways from the air and verifing the status of tracks and byways.
