I wrote [my original tubeless tyre post.](/posts/2019-11-12-tubless-tyre-setup.html) back in November 2019 when I built up my gravel bike. I was skeptical of the benefits of the new system and whether they would outway the additional faf.

Having put in a few hundred Ks on the new tubeless setup I think I've gotten to grips with it and can give you my opinion.

### They're great. I'm impressed.

The advantages of tubless can be summed up in two words for me: __no punctures__.

That's pretty much it. I have had multiple punctures on multiple rides over the last few months. Including, memorably, chunks of Hawthorne branches attaching themselves and being dragged around by the tyre. After the hedges on a section of local towpath had been flailed.

All have sealed within a few rotations of the wheel and, at worst all I've had to do is stop and top up the pressure in the tyre.

Keep the sealant topped up every few months and they'll look after you.

Definitely worth it for off-roading where the combination of larger, softer tyres and more things to stick in them makes punctures a far more frequent occurrence.
